# IEClear

IEClear is a Utility designed for use in Window's Internet Explorer. At any time, with Internet Explorer open, type "ieclear". The program will get all existing Internet Explorer tabs, and merge them all into 1 window.

# Why do I need IEClear?

The reason I invented IEClear is because often my desktop ended up like this:

If you type "ieclear" while this application is running all windows explorer windows will be reorganised in a single windows explorer window. Like this:

As you can see, all open Internet Explorer pages are now tabs in the current Internet Explorer window.

# Still not convinced?

No problem! If this never happens to you, then you won't need this utility. It happens to me constantly and I dislike having tabs of windows, each containing many tabs...
